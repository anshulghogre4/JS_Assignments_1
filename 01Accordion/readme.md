## Key learnings

- Learned the use case of events eg. onclick.
- Leaned about toggle function(it's just like a switch), where we add and remove the class when we click the button.
- Learned about firstChild and parentChild.
- Learned how to loop through the objects and print the details on to the screen.

## Time taken

- Honest time taken for it to do for the first time for me is one whole day. Did a lot of brainstorming with so many research, but it paid off.
